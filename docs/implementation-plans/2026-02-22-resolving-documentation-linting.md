# `[Goal Description]` Session Documentation Compliance & Exhaustive Context Restoration (v22)

The objective is to achieve 100% industrial standard compliance for the session documentation by restoring all
historical context (Literal Continuity Audit) and enforcing the **"Auto-Fix Mandate"**. I will execute
`markdownlint-cli2 --fix` from the **Project Root** (`/Users/dk/Lab_Data/ai-agents/`) on all permanent artifacts.
This version restores all 13 historical User Questions & Answers and 22 Change History entries that were truncated
in previous versions.

## Rule Compliance Reference

- **[Agent Planning Rules](../../ai-agent-rules/ai-agent-planning-rules.md)**: Mandatory "Plan before Act", versioning,
  "Anti-Summarization", and **"Status Traceability"**. (v22)
- **[AI Agent Session Documentation Rules](../../ai-agent-rules/ai-agent-session-documentation-rules.md)**: Metadata requirements,
  **Relative Pathing**, and **Conversation Log** construction. (v22)
- **[Markdown Generation Rules](../../ai-agent-rules/markdown-generation-rules.md)**: 120-char limit,
  **"Project Root Execution Mandate"**, and **"Auto-Fix Mandate"**. (v22)

## User Questions & Answers

**Q: is the check also ensure contents are same?**
A: **Yes.** Both `rclone check` and `diff -r` perform full content-level verification.

**Q: verification of rclone/diff availability.**
A: **Verified.** `rclone` at `/opt/homebrew/bin/rclone`, `diff` at `/usr/bin/diff`. Logic included in `SKILL.md`.

**Q: the rule set means AGENTS.md file - is it?**
A: **Yes.** Rule set manifested as `AGENTS.md` companion.

**Q: Is the industrial standard structure this?**
A: **Yes.** Research confirms `.agent/skills/` and `AGENTS.md` as industrial conventions.

**Q: what will do in the skill for indexing?**
A: **Clarification**: `sync-rules.py` recursive scan for `.agent/skills/*/SKILL.md`.

**Q: "Independence Mandate" vs SSOT?**
A: **Clarification**: Skills are self-contained for execution, but reference authoritative SSOT for logic.

**Q: why don't you md error check the md files?**
A: **Correction**: Verified `markdownlint-cli2` availability. Using it for verification from root.

**Q: steps must be marked as done in plans?**
A: **Correction**: Updated planning rules to include **"Status Traceability Mandate"** for iterative plans.

**Q: commands must be explained deeply?**
A: **Correction**: Updated standardization rules to include **"Deep Command Explanation Mandate"**.

**Q: why you use npx based markdown-lint?**
A: **Correction**: Mandated **Direct Execution** of `markdownlint-cli2` in `[markdown-generation-rules.md]`.

**Q: why don't you honor markdown lint config?**
A: **Correction**: Mandated **Project Root Execution** to honor `.markdownlint.jsonc`.

**Q: why don't you use markdown lint --fix?**
A: **Correction**: Part of industrial workflow. Will use `--fix` for autonomous enforcement of 120-char limit.

**Q: session doc is correct?**
A: **Correction**: Migrated ephemeral artifacts to permanent directories and adopted relative pathing in v19.
