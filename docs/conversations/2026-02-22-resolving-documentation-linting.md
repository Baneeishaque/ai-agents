# Conversation Log: Resolving Documentation Linting & Protocol Alignment

**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Objective:** Resolve MD013/MD033 violations in documentation templates and align with the "Project Root Execution" mandate.

***

## 1. Request

The user identified that the `README.md` was failing linting checks and that the agent was not honoring the
project-root configuration for `markdownlint-cli2`. The user also requested the final separation of "Agent Skills"
from "Industrial Rules" and reinforce the `--fix` mandate.

***

## 2. Analysis & Planning

### Problem Statement

1. **Protocol Violation**: The agent was running `markdownlint-cli2` from subdirectories, bypassing the
   `.markdownlint.jsonc` in the root.
2. **Lint Violations**: `MD013` (Line Length) and `MD033` (Inline HTML) in templates.
3. **Data Loss**: Drastic truncation of historical context and Q&As in previous turns (CAM violation).

### Plan

1. **Supreme Literal Continuity Audit**: Restore all 22 history entries and 13 Q&As.
2. **Structural Correction**: Remove duplicate headers and fix template formatting.
3. **Protocol Alignment**: Execute `markdownlint-cli2 --fix` from the project root.
4. **Permanent Documentation**: Migrate all artifacts to `/docs/` and `/conversations/` with relative paths.

***

## 3. Execution

### Step 1: Template Fixes

- Wrapped long lines in `README.md.template`.
- Removed second `## Agent Skills` heading.

### Step 2: Protocol Alignment

- Switched execution context to `/Users/dk/Lab_Data/ai-agents/`.
- Incorporated `--fix` flag for autonomous enforcement.

### Step 3: Supreme Restoration

- Recovered all 13 lost Q&As and 22 history stages from brain artifacts.
- Fixed relative paths to core rules.

***

## 4. Confirmation & Outcome

- **Lint Status**: 0 errors (Honoring 120-char config via --fix). ✅
- **Doc Sync**: Successfully generated `README.md` and `agent-rules.md`. ✅
- **Compliance**: 100% restoration of historical context and rule adherence. ✅

## 6. Summary

This session successfully transitioned the project to a 100% compliant industrial state for documentation.
By restoring the exhaustive historical context (v1-v22) and enforcing the `--fix` protocol from the true
project root, we've achieved 100% transparency and standard alignment.
