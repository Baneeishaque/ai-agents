# Session Log: Folder Comparison Skill & Core Rule Modernization (v13)

**Date**: 2026-02-22
**Conversation ID**: `4cb6ccec-1ad9-4f56-b908-0d84d9400f36`
**Objective**: Establish a portable Folder Comparison Skill and modernize core agent rules to industrial standards.

## Chronological Progress

1. **Initial Comparison (v1)**:
    - Verified `rclone` (`/opt/homebrew/bin/rclone`) and `diff` (`/usr/bin/diff`).
    - Compared `/Users/dk/.gemini/history/...` vs `/Users/dk/lab-temp/...`.
    - Identified matching contents (31 files) after excluding `.DS_Store`.
2. **Strategy Refinement (v2-v7)**:
    - User requested codification into a permanent Skill and Rule.
    - Researched industrial standards: `agentskills.io` for `SKILL.md` (Active Context) and
      `AGENTS.md` (Passive Context/Companion Bridge).
    - Transitioned to **Skill-First Architecture** with `.agent/skills/` directory structure.
3. **Core Rule Modernization (v8-v13)**:
    - Updated `ai-agent-planning-rules.md` to mandate **H1 versioning**, **Rule Compliance References**,
      **Anti-Summarization**, **Continuity Audit Mandate (CAM)**, **Temporal Hygiene**, and
      **Status Traceability** (marking DONE steps in plans).
    - (v13) **Literal Continuity Audit**: Restoration of truncated v11 context.
    - (v13) **Deep Command Explanation Mandate**: Codified flag-by-flag decoding for CLI.
    - Updated `ai-rule-standardization-rules.md` to mandate **Markdown Linting** and clarify the
      **Independence Mandate**.
4. **Skill Creation & Automation (v10-v13)**:
    - Established `.agent/skills/folder-comparison/` with `SKILL.md` and `AGENTS.md`.
    - Fixed "SMOT" typo to **SSOT** in `AGENTS.md`.
    - Updated `sync-rules.py` to recursively index `SKILL.md` files using both XML comments and YAML frontmatter.
5. **Verification**:
    - Achieved 100% compliance with `npx markdownlint-cli`.
    - Verified `agent-rules.md` correctly catalogs the new Skill.

## v13: Literal Context Restoration & Deep Explanations (2026-02-22)

As part of the **Literal Continuity Audit**, all historical context truncated in v12 was restored.
The **Deep Command Explanation Mandate** was added to `ai-rule-standardization-rules.md`, and
the `diff` command in `SKILL.md` was updated with a full flag breakdown (`-q`, `-r`, `-x`).
Final indexing was verified with 100% `markdownlint` compliance across 52 rule files.

## Tool Verification Results

| Tool | Status | Path | Version Check Command |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `rclone` | VERIFIED | `/opt/homebrew/bin/rclone` | `rclone --version` |
| `diff` | VERIFIED | `/usr/bin/diff` | `diff --version` |

## Rule Compliance Reference

This session followed:

- **[Agent Planning Rules](../../ai-agent-rules/ai-agent-planning-rules.md)** (v11 mandates applied).
- **[AI Agent Rule Standardization Rules](../../ai-agent-rules/ai-rule-standardization-rules.md)** (v11 mandates applied).

## Discovered Edge Cases

- **.DS_Store Noise**: macOS creates these automatically; exclusion is mandatory for clean diffs.
- **Hash vs Byte**: `rclone` hash checks are faster but `diff -r` provides full bit-level structural assurance.
  The skill mandates both.
- **Indexing Recursion**: Standardizing metadata parsing in `sync-rules.py` ensures Skills are visible in the
  central repository index.
