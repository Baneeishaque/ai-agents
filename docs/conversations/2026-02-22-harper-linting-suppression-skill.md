## Conversation Log: Harper Linting Suppression Protocol Implementation

**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Objective:** Create and standardize an AI Agent Skill to manage and suppress Harper linter false positives.

***

## 1. Request

> The user requested the creation of a Skill to handle false positives generated by the Harper linter against Python
> code and Markdown documentation, adhering strictly to the Skill-First architecture and project rules.

### Agent Response

Acknowledged the request and began planning the structure of the `SKILL.md` and `AGENTS.md` files based on the
project's standard rules.

***

## 2. Analysis & Planning

- Analyzed Harper's behavior, particularly its limitations parsing Python docstrings.
- Planned suppression strategies:
  1. Prose Rewriting (primary strategy for docstrings)
  2. Workspace Dictionary (`.harper-dictionary.txt` for common literals like `usr`, `env`, `ASC`, `md`)
  3. Standalone Ignoring (`# harper:ignore` comments)
- Consulted the user regarding an execution plan and refined it based on feedback (emphasizing consultative
  correction for auto-fixes).

***

## 3. Execution

- Created `.agent/skills/harper-linting-suppression/AGENTS.md` to bridge tools to the core instructions.
- Created `.agent/skills/harper-linting-suppression/SKILL.md` detailing the suppression protocol.
- Formatted rules, provided pedagogical command line breakdowns, and added case studies for common errors.
- Actively resolved `MD013` line-length linting errors and standardized the files according to `ai-rule-standardization-rules.md`.

***

## 4. Confirmation & Outcome

- The Harper Linting Suppression Protocol is fully documented and structured according to the latest standards.
- Handled edge cases such as lowercase file extensions (`.md`) vs capitalized proper nouns (`Markdown`).

## 6. Structured Data

### Requirements Table

| Requirement | Solution/Action | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Suppress file extensions in docstrings | Rewrite with plain English (e.g., "Markdown files") | Prose Rewriting Strategy |
| Handled repeated literals (`md`, `usr`) | Add to workspace `.harper-dictionary.txt` | Workspace Dictionary Strategy |
| Ignore specific weird formatting | Use standalone `# harper:ignore` comment | Standalone Ignore Strategy |
| Prevent incorrect auto-fixes | Enforce user-consultative workflow before fixes | Harper Error Handling Workflow |

## 7. Summary

Successfully created a standardized Harper Linting Suppression skill, defining clear, prioritized procedures for
mitigating false positives while maintaining documentation quality.
